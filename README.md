# Java Car Inheritance Example
A simple Java project to practice inheritance and method overriding.

It includes:
- `Car` class with basic car methods
- `Ev_Car` class that extends `Car` and overrides some methods
- `test_car` class to run the program

Running the program shows the difference between a regular car and an electric car.
